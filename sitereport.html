	<div class="TOPIC">
		<h2>"Experience of Learning "</h2><!--Topic of report-->
	   
	   <!--This is content of report-->
		<p>First of all,let me introduce myself Sungava Subedi and I am the student of (Bsc Computing) from NAMI College. After I passed my +2 , I was searching for IT college then after I was attracted by the learning process and environment of NAMI college which is totally different from other college. It's been only two month I joined NAMI college. It's just a beginning of learning in this course.Since, This month we learning  our modules through online classes because of pandemic situation. I am very excited to share my  physical and online learning experience.</p>
	  

	    <!--Basic details of report-->
        <p>All student have different way of learning. Learning experiences are really meaningful, challenging and interesting. My experience in this course is incredible because I am very interested in Web development. It's include web design, web programming, web publishing and it usually refers to creating and maintaining website. From the first week we learned about Github and how to create repository in Github account as well as we learn Github mechanism. Then after, We learned to create  web pages by using  html and css ,this was the most excited part because we use different tags and coding to creating, designing, maintaining our webpages. And we observed  many others thing like: layouts and positioning, inline elements, block elements, display properties, flex properties and float properties etc. These are the experience of physical class. </p>
      
            <!--This is the another paragraph-->
        <p> After week 6,We learned our modules through online classes. In my opinion, Physical class is much better than online class because online learning is difficult and stressful. I did hard work but I can't complete my work on time because of Internet problem or Electricity problem .Online class teach me one thing that I like is how to manage time for study and other work. And, In this course my online learning  experience is good because our module teacher teach us very well .We continued our topic and we learned about CSS3 properties, HTML forms and  so on  . In term of learning ,My best part is to do CSS3 colors, gradient, transform(translate) in tutorial. I really enjoying .For now my classes are running like this.</p>
           
          <h3>Experience of Assignment and Ups, Downs </h3>
        <!--This is the experience of doing this assignment-->
        <P>Now, I am sharing my experience ,ups and downs while  I doing this assignment. This was my first websites. When I doing this assignment it was exciting as well as difficult also. We had to make five responsive webpages . I start from home page. Then after, I look in the brief of assignment and I get some ideas and also searched in google websites. And start making the content of page are not work properly ,fonts and link are not working after hundred attemps my home page almost completed  but when I make hamburger icon it can't work properly .Then after, I search in google website and I use some code from codepen it can work properly and I use that hamburger icon code in all pages. Then after, I make portfolio pages it was easy because in this page we have to put dummy images for term II. After that, I made contact us page .In  contact page we had to make form and our contact also I written my contact in form placeholder. And I made cv page I written my skill, contact, personal information, language, qualification etc in cv. </p>

         <p>At last Sitereport, It was little bit difficult because I don't known the concept how to make this report after that I searched in google I doesn't find then i take some suggestion from module teacher .We have write experience of learning, have to give referencing of all images, code, icon which we use from websites.Almost I complete that part of report.When I do validation of all html and css there are many more error and I correction all error. And I give referencing of all web pages  in sitereport by harvard referencing style. It's my little part of assignment experience.</P>
            <!--Conclusion-->
        <p>This is my learning experience in web development, coding, design and debugging process of two month and experience of assignmentas well as ups and downs. I feel very lucky to share my  experiences with you.
            Thank you.</p>
