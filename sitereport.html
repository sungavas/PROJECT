        <p>All student have different way of learning.Learning experiences are really meaningful,challenging and interesting.My experience in this course is incredible because I am very intrested in Web development.It's include web degins,web programming,web publishing and it usually refers to creating and maintaining website.From the first week we learned about Github and how to create repository in Github account as well as we learn Github mechanism.Thenafter,we learned to create  web pages by using  html and css ,this was the most excited part because we use different tags and coding to creating, designing, maintaining our webpages.And we observed  many others thing like: layouts and positioning,inline elements,block elements,display properties,flex properties and float properties etc.These are the experience of physical class. </p>

      	   <p> After week 6 we learned our modules through online classes.In my opinion,Physical class is much better than online class because online learning is difficult and stressful.I did hard work but I can't complete my work on time because of Internet problem or Electricity problem .Onlineclass teached  me one thing that i like is how to manage time for study and other work. And,In this course my online learning  experience is good beacause our module teacher teached us very well .We continued our topic and we learned about CSS3 properties,HTML forms and  so on.In term of learning ,My best part is to do CSS3 colors,gradient,transform(translate) in tutorial.I really enjoying .For now,My classes are running like this.</p>
